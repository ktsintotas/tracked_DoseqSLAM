# Tracking-DOSeqSLAM: A Dynamic Sequence-Based Visual Place Recognition Paradigm

This open source MATLAB algorith presents a low complexity loop closure detection pipeline wherein the traversed trajectory (map) is represented by sequence-based locations (sub-maps). Each of these groups-of-images is generated on-line through a pointsâ€™ tracking repeatability check employed on the perceived visual sensory information. When querying the database, the proper candidate place is selected and, through an image-to-image search, the appropriate location is chosen.
