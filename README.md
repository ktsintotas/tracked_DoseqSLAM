# Tracking‐DOSeqSLAM: A dynamic sequence‐based visual place recognition paradigm

This open source MATLAB algorith presents a low complexity loop closure detection pipeline wherein the traversed trajectory (map) is represented by sequence-based locations (sub-maps).
Each of these groups-of-images is generated on-line through a points’ tracking repeatability check employed on the perceived visual sensory information.
When querying the database, the proper candidate place is selected and, through an image-to-image search, the appropriate location is chosen.

The Tracking-DOSeqSLAM approach is a research code.
